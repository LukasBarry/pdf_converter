# PDF Converter

Created to handle issues we were having with opening PDFs in Microsoft Edge, and when printing PDF files for game reports

With this app, you can browse and select the PDF file you need to use, hit the submit button, and it will convert the PDF using Ghostscript to be compatible with Edge

Once the conversion is complete, it will automatically redirect to an inline browser view of the new PDF that can now either be downloaded or printed directly

### To Run Locally:

- `cd` to the app directory
- run `rackup` in your terminal
- go to `localhost:9292`
- convert away!
